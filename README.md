# â˜•Coffee Shop Sales Analysis Dashboard

This project analyzes coffee shop sales data using **Microsoft Excel**.  
The dataset was provided by **Maven Analytics** (credits to them).  

## Project Objectives

### Objective 1: Data Preparation
- Explored the dataset to understand the number of transactions and time period covered.  
- Identified products and product categories sold.  
- Added calculated columns:
  - **Revenue** = `Price * Quantity`
  - **Month** (as text, e.g., "Jan", "Feb")
  - **Day of Week** (as text, e.g., "Mon", "Tue")
  - **Hour** (extracted from transaction time)

### Objective 2: Data Exploration with Pivot Tables
Created PivotTables to analyze sales trends:
- **Revenue by Month**
- **Transactions by Day of Week**
- **Transactions by Hour of Day**
- **Transactions by Product Category** (sorted descending)
- **Top 15 Product Types** by transactions and revenue

---

### Objective 3: Dashboard Creation
Built a dynamic dashboard in Excel:
- **Line Chart** for revenue by month  
- **Column Charts** for transactions by day of week & hour of day  
- **Bar Chart** for transactions by product category  
- Added a PivotTable for **Top 15 product types**  
- Included **Slicer for store location** (applied to all PivotTables)  
- Applied formatting, alignment, and dashboard layout design

## Insights & Recommendations
- Sales peak during **morning hours** (commuter rush).  
- Certain product categories drive higher transaction volumes (e.g., coffee-based drinks).  
- Monthly revenue shows **seasonal patterns**, which can guide promotions.  
- Recommendations:
  - Offer **time-based promotions** in off-peak hours.  
  - Optimize inventory for **top-selling product categories**.  
  - Focus marketing on **high-revenue months** to maximize sales.
